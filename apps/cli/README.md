# Firestore Facade CLI

This package contains the CLI used to generate the facade factory function. It depends on TSX so this needs to be installed too.

For more information see the [firestore-facade documentation](https://github.com/0x80/firestore-facade)

## Usage

`npm install @firestore-facade/cli tsx --save-dev`

`npx generate-facade ./path/to/facade.config.ts`
