# Firestore Fa√ßade Packages

A simplified, strongly-typed, zero-dependency API for Typescript projects using
Firestore.

See the [Facade package README](./packages/facade/README.md) for more details.

## Disclaimer

Currently only Node.js is supported, and the CLI has been tested only on MacOS.

## Packages

- [@firestore-facade/server](./packages/facade/README.md): The Firestore Facade server API for
  Node.js

## Apps
- [@firestore-facade/cli](./packages/cli/README.md): The command-line tool
  for generating the facade boilerplate


## Examples
- [node](./apps/example-nodejs/README.md): A Node.js example showcasing the use of `@firestore-facade/cli` and `s@firestore-facade/server`.

## Supported Platforms

At the moment this project focusses on Node.js using the
[firebase-admin](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-node) client, and
the most of the code is providing patterns that are useful for backend
applications.

In the future this should be made compatible with the
[Cloud Firestore](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-firestore) with little
modification, because both are technically the same product.

Applying same the concept to the Firebase web client should also be possible, however
it would probably not be trivial because not all of the used
functionality of the `firebase-admin` package is available in the web client.

I plan to investigate if the concept is also feasible for a web and I would be
specifically interested in using it for React hooks.
